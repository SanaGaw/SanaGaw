Below is a concise table illustrating nine “synthetic” regional parameter sets, each with a brief rationale for why those numbers make sense historically/anthropologically. You can use these as baselines and refine further with real data later.

Region	#Citizens	#Bureaucrats	Rounds	Salary	Bribe	Invest. Rate	Invest. Cost	initCorrCit	initCorrBur	initBudget	Rationale
Scandinavian	100	20	12	8	1	15	3	0.10	0.05	1500	Low corruption tradition; strong rule of law, high transparency. Higher budget & proactive investigations reflect robust state capacity. Bribes minimal.
Northern America	100	20	12	6	2	10	4	0.15	0.10	1200	Generally low–moderate corruption. Good enforcement resources but not as high as Scandinavia. Slightly higher bribe amount.
South America	100	20	12	4	3	8	2	0.35	0.30	800	Some countries have moderate–high corruption in public sector. Budget smaller. Bribes a bit larger. Investigations less frequent, reflecting partial institutional strength.
Middle East	100	20	12	4	4	7	3	0.40	0.35	900	Historically moderate–high corruption in some states, budgets vary widely but we assume moderate. Bribe amounts higher. Investigations exist but not at high levels.
Asia	150	30	12	4	2	10	2	0.25	0.20	1000	Large population (hence more citizens/bureaucrats). Moderate corruption, moderate bribe amounts, decent budget. Investigations somewhat frequent, cost is moderate.
Mediterranean (EU)	100	20	12	6	2	9	3	0.20	0.15	900	Countries in Southern EU often have moderate corruption levels—still below many global averages. Budget is decent, bribes not too large, moderate investigation frequency.
Africa	100	20	12	3	3	6	2	0.45	0.40	700	Many states have lower budgets, higher baseline corruption. Investigations exist but cost is lower. Salary is minimal. Higher proportion of corruption among citizens/bureaucrats.
Post-Soviet	100	20	12	4	4	8	2	0.30	0.35	1000	Some residual structures from Soviet legacy can yield moderate–high bureaucratic corruption. Budget is mid-range. Bribe amounts are fairly large. Investigations are moderately frequent/costly.
South Korea	120	25	12	7	2	12	3	0.20	0.25	1300	Historically had corruption in chaebols/govt, but modern crackdowns. Higher salary vs. some regions. Investigations fairly proactive. Bribe amounts moderate.
How to Use This Table
Rows: Each row corresponds to a synthetic region with approximate corruption contexts.
Columns: Show the parameters you’ll set in params = {...} for your ABM:
num_citizens: total citizens.
num_bureaucrats: total bureaucrats.
rounds: how many steps your simulation runs.
salary: how much each bureaucrat is paid per round.
bribe_amount: how much a citizen pays a corrupt bureaucrat each bribe.
investigation_rate: how many bureaucrats are randomly investigated each round.
investigation_cost: cost to investigate each bureaucrat.
initial_corruption_citizens / bureaucrats: fraction that begins corrupt.
initial_budget: starting budget for your institution.
Rationale: short notes on why these numbers suit that region’s corruption patterns.
Adjust any values to better match specific data or to test alternative scenarios (e.g., higher budgets, more or fewer rounds, bigger or smaller populations). These synthetic sets are just a baseline to highlight differences across global regions for your corruption-model simulation.
